## About Legato 
**Note:** This repository contains the core code of the 
Legato framework. If you want to build an application using Legato, 
visit the main [Legato repository](https://github.com/terdia/legato).

Legato is a simple yet powerful PHP framework for rapid application development that is suited for small to medium scale apps and APIs.

Legato framework is a seamless integration of powerful PHP packages from Symfony Components, illuminate, etc. with high performance.

Legato is for PHP developers who want to build apps instead of coding common things like validation, routing, database manipulation, etc. from scratch. Legato offers a set of well-defined toolkits that take care of those things allowing you to focus on building your app.
